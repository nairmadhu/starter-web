So I needed something that could help us with the compatibility issue. And
something that will allow us to modify or change these components without affecting
the other components and even modify the underlying operating systems as
required. And that search landed me on Docker. With Docker I was able to run each
component in a separate container – with its own libraries and its own dependencies.
All on the same VM and the OS, but within separate environments or containers. We
just had to build the docker configuration once, and all our developers could now get
started with a simple “docker run” command. Irrespective of what underlying OS they
run, all they needed to do was to make sure they had Docker installed on their
systems
